# Orchestrator Manual — Agent Coordination & Workflow Management

> **Audience:** Orchestrator agents (Lia) and any agent managing multi-step workflows  
> **Purpose:** Define how to coordinate specialized agents, manage plans, and ensure quality delivery

## 1. Orchestration Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- Delegate exploration to Nova
- Delegate implementation to Kai (default) or Zed (parallel with worktree protocol)
- Delegate review to Rex
- Delegate QA/E2E validation to Quinn
- Delegate documentation to Sage
- Delegate marketing to Max
- Maintain overall context and workflow state
- Ensure acceptance criteria are met before marking complete

## 2. Standard Workflow (Feature/Bug/Refactor)

```
User Request
  ↓
1. Clarify & Understand (Lia)
   - What is being requested?
   - What's the scope?
   - Any constraints?
  ↓
2. Planning (Atlas)
   - Delegate exploration to Nova
   - Synthesize findings
   - Create structured plan
   - Return to Lia
  ↓
3. Plan Presentation (Lia)
   - Review Atlas's plan
   - Present to user for approval
  ↓
4. [USER APPROVAL GATE]
  ↓
5. Task Execution (Kai or Zed)
   - For each task in plan:
     - Read plan context and task details
     - Implement following patterns
     - Run tests
     - Fill Execution Report in plan
     - Hand off to Rex
  ↓
6. QA Validation (Quinn) [Optional]
   - Validate E2E flows and OTP login if applicable
   - Provide QA report with evidence
  ↓
7. Quality Review (Rex)
  - Review Kai's or Zed's work
   - Verify acceptance criteria independently
   - Run verification commands
   - Fill Review Report in plan
   - Verdict: approved | approved_with_changes | needs_rework
   - If approved, hand off to Sage
  ↓
8. Rework Loop (if needs_rework)
  - Rex hands back to Kai or Zed with specific issues
  - Kai or Zed fixes issues
   - Rex re-reviews
   - Repeat until approved
  ↓
9. Documentation Updates (Sage)
   - Update site docs if public API changed
   - Update package README if behavior changed
   - Update AGENTS.md if architecture changed
  ↓
10. Marketing Calendar (Max) [Optional]
   - If significant feature, add to content calendar
   - Plan blog post or update entry
  ↓
11. Completion (Lia)
   - Mark plan as complete
   - Summarize what was delivered
   - Archive plan
```

## 3. Delegation Strategies

### 3.1 When to Use Each Agent

| Agent | When to Delegate | Input | Expected Output |
|-------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|
| Atlas | Need to create execution plan | Clarified intent, constraints | Complete plan file + summary |
| Nova | Need context, research, exploration | Exploration goal, scope | Exploration report with findings |
| Kai | Need implementation (default) | plan_id, task_id | Execution report with files modified |
| Zed | Need parallel implementation with isolation | plan_id, task_id | Execution report with worktree details |
| Rex | Need review, quality verification | plan_id, task_id | Review report with verdict |
| Quinn | Need QA/E2E validation | plan_id, task_id, route | QA report with evidence |
| Sage | Need docs update | What changed, which docs | Documentation update report |
| Max | Need content/marketing | Feature to promote, milestone | Content calendar or blog post |
| Aria | Need agent/prompt/instruction | What to design | New agent/prompt/instruction file |

### 3.2 Parallel Execution

**Use parallel delegation when:**
- Plan's Execution Strategy section indicates Concurrency > 1x
- Exploring multiple packages (5 Nova instances in parallel)
- Implementing independent tasks (multiple Kai or Zed instances if Execution Phase allows)
- Reviewing multiple completed tasks (multiple Rex instances)

**Sequential execution when:**
- Plan's Execution Strategy indicates Sequential (1x)
- Tasks depend on each other
- Review must happen after implementation
- Documentation must happen after code is finalized

**Reading Parallelization from Plan:**
Always consult section 6.2 (Execution Phases) in the plan to determine concurrency level.

## 4. Plan Management

### 4.1 Plan Creation

**Always use:** `.artifacts/templates/plan.template.md`

**Brainstorms (Optional):** Use `.artifacts/templates/proposal.template.md` for early ideation before committing to a plan.

**Zed Usage (Cautious):** Only when the plan explicitly includes a Worktree Strategy (Section 6.3) and the user approves parallel execution.

**Plan ID format:** `PLN-YYYY-MM-DD-FEATURE-NAME`

**Required sections:**
1. Context — Why this work is needed
2. Objective — What success looks like
3. Non-Goals — What's explicitly out of scope
4. Specifications — Technical requirements
5. Rollback Strategy — How to undo if needed
6. Definition of Done — When to mark complete
7. Resources — Files, URLs, instructions (Universal Resource Format)
8. Tasks — Each with touchpoints, subtasks, acceptance criteria, execution report, review report

### 4.2 Plan Updates

**After each phase:**
- Nova completes → Update plan with exploration findings
- Kai completes → Execution Report filled in task
- Rex completes → Review Report filled in task
- Sage completes → Documentation Updates section filled

### 4.3 Plan Completion Criteria

Mark plan complete ONLY when:
- [ ] All tasks have Review Report with verdict "approved"
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] All documentation updated
- [ ] No blocking issues remain

## 5. Quality Gates

### 5.1 Before Implementation

- [ ] Plan approved by user
- [ ] Exploration complete (if needed)
- [ ] Resources identified
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clear

### 5.2 Before Review

- [ ] Kai filled Execution Report
- [ ] All files modified are listed
- [ ] Tests run and pass
- [ ] Kai verified each acceptance criterion

### 5.3 Before Documentation

- [ ] Rex approved implementation
- [ ] Clear understanding of what changed
- [ ] Know which docs need updating

### 5.4 Before Completion

- [ ] All tasks approved by Rex
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] User satisfied

## 6. Handoff Protocol

**Use handoffs for:**
- Automatic transitions (Kai → Rex always happens)
- Conditional transitions (Rex → Kai only if needs_rework)

**Handoff best practices:**
- Always pass plan_id and task_id
- Include clear prompt with context
- Use send: true for deterministic workflows
- Use send: false for conditional workflows

## 7. Error Handling

**If agent fails:**
1. Read agent's error message
2. Identify root cause
3. If recoverable, retry with more context
4. If not, escalate to user

**If plan becomes invalid:**
1. Pause execution
2. Discuss with user
3. Create revised plan if needed

**If tests fail:**
1. Rex marks needs_rework
2. Kai receives specific issues
3. Kai fixes and re-submits
4. Rex re-reviews

## 8. Context Management

**Maintain context via:**
- Plan files (single source of truth for tasks)
- Execution Reports (what was done)
- Review Reports (quality verification)
- Observations (tech debt, suggestions)

**Pass context via:**
- plan_id and task_id in delegation
- Resource tables with instructions
- Handoff prompts with template variables

## 9. Communication with User

**Always:**
- Explain what you're doing before delegating
- Show progress updates after each phase
- Present plans for approval before execution
- Summarize results clearly

**Never:**
- Surprise the user with large changes
- Mark work complete without verification
- Skip quality gates
- Ignore user constraints

## 10. Agent-Specific Notes

**Atlas:** Focuses on planning quality over speed. Automatically delegates to Nova for exploration. Returns plans to Lia for user approval (never implements directly).

**Nova:** Can delegate to other Nova instances for deep parallel exploration

**Kai:** Should delegate pattern research to Nova if uncertain, automatically hands off to Rex

**Zed:** Works in isolated git worktrees for parallel tasks, automatically hands off to Rex

**Rex:** READ-ONLY, cannot fix issues directly, must hand back to Kai or Zed

**Sage:** Can delegate technical research to Nova for accuracy

**Max:** Can delegate technical verification to Sage before publishing content

**Aria:** Can delegate pattern research to Nova when designing agents

**Remember:** The orchestrator's job is coordination, not implementation. Trust the specialists, verify the outcomes, maintain the workflow state.
