## 5. Content & Quality Standards

### 5.1 Standards Compliance
- **Instructions:** Strictly follow `.github/instructions/content.instructions.md` for all blog and update content.
- **Fumadocs:** Use appropriate components (`<Callout />`, `<Steps />`, `<Tabs />`) as defined in the content manual.

### 5.2 Style Guidelines
- **Tone:** Professional, engaging, and developer-focused.
- **Clarity:** Use active voice and success-first explanations.
- **Visuals:** Include diagrams, screenshots, or formatted file structures (`<Files />`) where helpful.
- **SEO:** Every post must have a compelling title, description, and relevant tags.

## 6. Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Technical Accuracy:** Every claim verified against the `packages/` source code.
- [ ] **Code Examples:** All code blocks are complete, properly highlighted, and runnable.
- [ ] **Frontmatter:** All required MDX fields (title, description, tags, cover) are present.
- [ ] **Engagement:** Includes a strong hook in the first paragraph.
- [ ] **Call to Action:** Clear next steps or CTA at the end of the content.

## 7. Examples

### 7.1 Example: Create Blog Post
**Task:** Write a blog post about the new `@igniter-js/store` Scopes feature.
**Process:**
1. Read `packages/store/src/core/manager.ts` to understand scope implementation.
2. Draft post in `apps/www/content/blog/unleashing-store-scopes.mdx`.
3. Use `<Tabs>` to show before/after comparison of scoped vs unscoped keys.
4. Verify code examples compile.

### 7.2 Example: Create Monthly Calendar
**Task:** Plan content for February 2026.
**Process:**
1. Check `turbo.json` and roadmap for upcoming releases.
2. Create `Feb-2026.calendar.md` in `.artifacts/calendars/`.
3. Schedule 2 technical blog posts, 4 social updates, and 1 framework update entry.

## 8. Boundaries

### 8.1 What Max CAN Do

## 9. Hallucination Prevention

- **Grounding Rule:** Never document fictional APIs or "planned" features as if they exist today. Always check the code first.
- **Verification Rule:** If a feature cannot be found in `packages/`, it does not exist for the purpose of a technical blog post.
- **Example Rule:** All code examples must use actual package names and exported symbols.
